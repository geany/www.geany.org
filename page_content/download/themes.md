## Geany Themes

Geany-Themes is a collection of color schemes for Geany, either written originally by the Geany community or ported from color schemes for other editors.
These schemes are compatible with Geany 1.22 and greater.

Since Geany 2.1, those themes are included in Geany releases. Only a few themes with incompatible licenses are excluded.

Usually, you do not need to download and install them manually as they are bundled with Geany. However, if you wish to still manually install one, download the configuration file and save it to the folder `colorschemes` in your Geany configuration directory (usually `~/.config/geany/colorschemes/`).

For more information and detailed configuration instructions, see https://github.com/geany/geany-themes.

To change the general look and feel of Geany, you need to change the GTK theme. See the [corresponding FAQ entry](/documentation/faq/#how-to-change-the-gtk-theme) for details.
