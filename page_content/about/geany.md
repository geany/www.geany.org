About Geany
==========

Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK3 runtime libraries.

The code is licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public Licence][3].
