<h3>What is pastebin?</h3>
<p>pastebin is here to help you collaborate on debugging code snippets. If you're not familiar with the idea,
most people use it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="{% url 'home' %}">submit</a> a code fragment to pastebin,
getting a url like http://{{ request.site.domain }}/abc1234</li>
<li>paste the url into an IRC or IM conversation</li>
<li>someone responds by reading and perhaps submitting a modification of your code</li>
<li>you then view the modification, maybe using the built in diff tool to help locate the changes</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can I view the differences between two posts?</h3>
<p>When you view a post, you have the opportunity of editing the text - <strong>this creates a new post</strong>,
but when you view it, you'll be given a 'diff' link which allows you to compare the changes between the old and the new version</p>
<p>This is a powerful feature, great for seeing exactly what lines someone changed</p>

<h3>How can I delete a post?</h3>
<p>If you clicked the "remember me" checkbox when posting, you will be able to delete post from the same computer you posted from -
simply view the post and click the "delete post" link.</p>
<p>In other cases, contact us and we will delete it for you.</p>
